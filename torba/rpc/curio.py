    optional set of existing tasks to put into the group. New tasks
    can later be added using the spawn() method below. wait specifies
    the policy used for waiting for tasks. See the join() method
    below. Each TaskGroup is an independent entity. Task groups do not
    form a hierarchy or any kind of relationship to other previously
    created task groups or tasks. Moreover, Tasks created by the top
    level spawn() function are not placed into any task group. To
    create a task in a group, it should be created using
    TaskGroup.spawn() or explicitly added using TaskGroup.add_task().

    completed attribute: the first task that completed with a result
    in the group.  Takes into account the wait option used in the
    TaskGroup constructor (but not in the join method)`.
